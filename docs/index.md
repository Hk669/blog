# Hey there!

I'm Hrushikesh Dokala, and I'm currently diving deep into AI infrastructure and understanding LLMs. I specialize in backend development and love contributing to open source projects. I'm a **Beta** Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors

*Currently seeking internship opportunities. Grateful for any leads shared. Thank you in advance.*

**Fun fact**: When I'm not coding, you can find me on the football field, enjoying the beautiful game and staying active.

## Packages I Built

built my own tokenizer package to train the Tokenizer of LLM.
- [bpetokenizer](https://pypi.org/project/bpetokenizer/), supports special tokens and regex expression. (inspired from tiktoken)
