# Hey there!

I'm Hrushikesh Dokala, and I'm currently a *Maintainer* at [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), diving deep into AI infrastructure and building applications around AI Agents. I specialize in backend development and love contributing to open source projects. I'm a **Beta** Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors.

*Currently seeking internship opportunities. Grateful for any leads shared. Thank you in advance.*


## Packages I Built
