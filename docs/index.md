## Startup

As a Co-Founder of [AdVantage](https://advantagecommunity.in), we're spearheading a transformative movement in education, particularly aimed at tier 2 and 3 college students. Recognizing the common struggle many students face in connecting and networking with tech-savvy individuals, our platform serves as the ideal solution.

Here's what sets us apart:

- We curate high-quality and effective communities on our platform, ensuring students have access to the best resources.
- All workshops hosted by these communities are entirely free for students, eliminating financial barriers to participation.
- Students are encouraged to contribute by writing blogs, sharing insights, and engaging in discussions.
- Our discussion forum facilitates direct interaction with seasoned tech professionals, providing invaluable mentorship and guidance.
- In essence, we're not just a platform; we're a gateway to enhanced visibility, peer-to-peer learning, and sustainable growth for aspiring tech enthusiasts.

> we're inviting developers and mentors to support us and contribute to make this a one stop place for the students.

Thanks for stopping by!
